						<h2>What am I about?</h2>
						<p>I'm a fresh computer science graduate, wanting to enter the tech industry as a developer.<br />
						My interest is in algorithms, AI and data. I'm motivated by problem solving. Where needed, I can make things look pretty, but my focus is functionality.<br />
						Get an idea of some of my previous projects below</p>

										<h3>Machine Learning based upon decision trees</h3>

							</header>
							<p>Part of my final project is building a machine learning program based upon decision trees. This was done using C++ and using data sets obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. This program works well with binary sets, and explodes when considering complex data sets. It is currently being refactored to handle more complex data sets, and to be data agnostic.</p>

										<h3>Encryption program</h3>

							</header>
							<p>Last year I took a paper in networks and security. I felt horribly mislead as it was 90% networks, and 10% security based. As part of the security module I developed a socket program which encrypts and decrypts messages, sent and received via TCP.</p>

										<h3>Fuzzy Logic controller</h3>

							</header>
							<p>I created a fuzzy logic control system to solve  a virtual pendulum and cart problem. I really enjoyed this project, although by the time I submitted it, I was only 'mostly' successful. The pendulum balances, but then slowly wanders off to one side with infinite happiness. I'm interested in readdressing this problem when time permits.</p>

										<h3>8-puzzle problem</h3>

							<p>The 8-puzzle problem was used as a method of exploring different space-state search algorithms. Despite the simplicity of this project, I really enjoyed it. It greatly enhanced my knowledge of the algorithms used. These included breadth-first search, breadth-first search with visited list, progressive deepening search, uniform cost search with expanded list and A* search with expanded list.</p>

							<p>I can make websites by hand, but I will typically use a website builder. I have a preference for Wix, though I have on occasion used WordPress. The link below is an example of a website I created using Wix.</p>

										<h3>Android Apps</h3>
								</div>
								</div>
							</header>
							<p>I took an Android developer paper at uni, which I was surprised to have enjoyed so much. I didn't make anything too complex here. I've made a simple telephone app, a gallery app, a catch phrase game clone (which gets a surprising amount of use despite looking incredibly boring). I've also been working on a circus specific gallery app. It's currently on the back burner while I finish off uni. Mostly I've used Java, though I have played a little bit with React. To tell you I am 'experienced' in React would be stretching the truth. I can always dust that off if needed though.</p>

						<h2>Experience</h2>
						<p>In 2018 I had an internship as a software developer. The focused on building and testing web and mobile applications. I spent a lot of my time doing back end work such as creating end points. I also spent a lot of time writing unit tests. I worked with JavaScript and Node JS. Testing was doen using Jest and Hapi testing suites.<br />
						<p>I'm also an experienced technical writer. I specialise in communicating technical knowledge to the non-technical person. I am familiar with producing a range of technical documentation. This ranges from system specifications to user guides. I do like technical writing, but I'm itching to develop my technical skills over my communication skills.
